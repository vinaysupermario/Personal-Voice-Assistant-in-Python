****Side Notes****
1. The above mentioned modules are all python modules that can be downloaded for free, although their might be some API charges extra
2. The Modules SpeechRecognition, Wolframalpha, Pyvona together form heart of this voice assistant i.e. their functionality is absolutely
   required at all times, and without them this application isn't capable of doing what it is supposed to do. Every voice assistant has
   these modules in one form or other having same underlying priciples as these modules
3. The rest of the modules are featuristic modules which are loosely tied with the application which can be applied and removed as per
   user wishes. These modules are used here to provide certain useful features which can be performed with the assistant and helps provide
   more usecases for this application.
